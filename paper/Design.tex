\section{Experiment Design}
\label{Experiment Design}
% This should be fairly brief, the system is not particularly complex.

\subsection{System Design}
% RPI interface to MiniPIX, heatsink design etc.
\subsection{Configuration and Calibration}
% Device parameters, threshold, bias voltage, shutter time etc.
