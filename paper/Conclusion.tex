% Report Findings, report what the overall goal of the project and if the goals were met in the end.
%%
Both 2017 and 2018 high altitude balloon flights proved successful.  
%%
The MiniPIX gathered a wealth of data after flying for \SI{19.5}{\hour} at altitudes between \SI{30}{\kilo\meter} and \SI{40}{\kilo\meter}.  
%%
In the 2017 flight, dose rate peaked at approximately \SI{4.8}{\micro\gray\per\hour} while the 2018 flight dose rate peaked at \SI{4.8}{\micro\gray\per\hour}.  
%%
Flying at altitudes beyond \SI{30}{\kilo\meter} , both flights observed the Pfotzer-Regener maximum.
%%
Overall, the MiniPIX device performed beyond expectations, proving to function adequately in the upper atmosphere, but also successfully operating as a low-cost device for dosimetry applications.
%%
MORE TO COME.  Taking a break to drive home.
%%Overall, the device performed adequately and is potentially suitable for future applications in other areas...
%%
%%Discuss briefly (IN ONE OR TWO SENTENCES) future applications of the MiniPIX for compact, cheap and accurate(?) dosimeters on commercial airline flights
%%THIS FITS BETTER SOMEWHERE ELSE; INTRODUCTION, BACKGROUND AND DISCUSSION.
%%The authors of this paper have made arrangements to collaborate with Dr. Lawrence Pinsky and Dr. Stuart George of the University of Houston to develop a portable, TimePIX-based device capable of detecting thermal neutrons. The motivation behind this project is to investigate the production rates of and passenger exposure to thermal neutrons during commercial air flights by building off of the previous work done by groups such as B.J. Lewis et al. \cite{aircrewexposure} and C. Granga and S. Pospisil \cite{timepixdosimetry}.

%%From abstract:
%%The latest results from the two radiation experiments onboard of SORA (Stratospheric Organisms and Radiation Analyzer) high altitude balloon flights are presented.  The SORA payload included a semiconductor pixel detector, the MiniPIX, for cosmic ray studies and imaging in the stratosphere at altitudes of 30 to 40 kilometers.  
%%The MiniPIX was interfaced with a low-powered  computer, a Raspberry Pi 3. The MiniPIX was set to TOT (time over threshold mode) and monitored cosmic radiation for a total flight time of 19.5 hours on two separate flights.  The results from the SORA flights were evaluated for providing a basis for future low cost cosmic ray tracking platforms on high altitude balloons and satellites.
