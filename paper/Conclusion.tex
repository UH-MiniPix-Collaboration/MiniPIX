\label{Conclusion}
% Report Findings, report what the overall goal of the project and if the goals were met in the end.

Overall, the device performed adequately and is potentially suitable for future applications in other areas...


% Discuss briefly (IN ONE OR TWO SENTENCES) future applications of the MiniPIX for compact, cheap and accurate(?) dosimeters on commercial airline flights
%THIS FITS BETTER SOMEWHERE ELSE; INTRODUCTION, BACKGROUND AND DISCUSSION.
%The authors of this paper have made arrangements to collaborate with Dr. Lawrence Pinsky and Dr. Stuart George of the University of Houston to develop a portable, TimePIX-based device capable of detecting thermal neutrons. The motivation behind this project is to investigate the production rates of and passenger exposure to thermal neutrons during commercial air flights by building off of the previous work done by groups such as B.J. Lewis et al. \cite{aircrewexposure} and C. Granga and S. Pospisil \cite{timepixdosimetry}.
