\section{Results & Discussion}
\subsection{Results}
%
%Report results first, including figures, particle count, dose, altitude, and temperatures. 
%
\label{Discussion}
%Introduce the basic system again and how it was briefly setup.
%
%Discuss dose and particle count measurements as they relate to classical theory
%
%Make statements about how the simulations were setup.
%
%Talk about the success of the overall PAYLOAD briefly.
\subsection{System Performance}
%
% Here its just specific discussion about the system performance.
%Talk about success of overall SYSTEM.  Include TEMP data about the flight and hardware of the system.  Mention altitude, humidity, and any atmospheric conditions available for both flights.   
%
\subsection{Model Simulations}
%
%New section where we will include details about simulations that Reed and Steven are creating.
