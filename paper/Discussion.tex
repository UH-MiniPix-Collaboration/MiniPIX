%Report results first, including figures, particle count, dose, altitude, and temperatures.
\section{Discussion}
\label{Discussion}
%Introduce the basic system again and how it was briefly setup.
%Discuss dose and particle count measurements as they relate to classical theory
% Maybe we can put the ``System performance'' section up here as an introduction to the discussion section?
%Talk about the success of the overall PAYLOAD briefly.
\subsection{System Performance}
% Is this section needed in the discussion or can we just slip this information in when we mention the plots?
% Here its just specific discussion about the system performance.
% Talk about success of overall SYSTEM.  Include TEMP data about the flight and hardware of the system.  Mention altitude, humidity, and any atmospheric conditions available for both flights.
\subsection{Space Weather}
% Relevancy of space weather to commercial airlines.
% Astronauts' time in space is decreasing.
\subsection{Success of SORA Relative to Others}
% Detail the results which match NASA's article about the disappearance of the plotzer maximum
% Mention the need for a low-cost dosimeter and how our configuration is reaching that goal. The only setback in the high-cost of the commercially unavailable MiniPIX.
% Mars environment
