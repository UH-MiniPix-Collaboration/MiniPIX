During the HASP 2017\cite{hasp} flight, the MiniPIX hybrid pixel detector\cite{minipix} was used to measure levels of cosmic radiation experienced by 
the SORA payload\cite{sora}. Presented in this paper are the methods used and measurements recorded during the aforementioned HASP stratospheric balloon flight. 
The MiniPIX utilizes a TimePIX\cite{timepix} silicon detector designed by CERN\cite{cern} and relays the recorded data through its USB 2.0 interface provided by 
ADVACAM\cite{advacam}. The detector boarded a Raspberry PI 3 (RPI3) which ran the device in time over threshold (TOT) mode measuring deposited energy onto each 
pixel per frame throughout the flight. Frames were collected every \SI{4}{\second} with roughly a \SI{6}{\second} reset period. Data acquisitions began at power 
up prior to launch and ended at power down prior to freefall. The HASP 2017 flight launched from Fort Sumner, New Mexico on August 4th, 2017 at 14:04 UTC 
and ascended to a float altitude of about $\SI{31.5}{\kilo\meter}$ at 16:22 UTC which was maintained for about \SI{10.5}{\hour}. The payload drifted west 
for a total ground distance of \SI{580}{\kilo\meter} and was recovered just north of the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest in Arizona.
