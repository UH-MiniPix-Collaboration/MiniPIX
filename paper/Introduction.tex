\section{Introduction}
\label{Introduction}
The atmospheric radiation environments is a highly complex mix of primary and secondary particles originating from Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR). In the earth’s atmosphere, primary GCR interact with the molecules in the upper atmosphere and produce cascades of secondary particles that increase in intensity until reaching a maximum between 16km and 18km known as the Regener-Pfotzer Maximum. After reaching peak ionization rates, the flux of secondary and primary particles then decreases steadily until reaching a minimum near the earths surface(cite). This peak in ionization in the atmosphere has implications to passengers and crew aboard high flying aircraft and astronauts, who will absorb a much higher biological dose than they would at the earths surface.  Crew and passengers aboard a standard passenger plane flying at a cruising altitude of approximately 13km are exposed to dose rates that are 40 times higher than they would experience on the earths surface(cite) and crew members aboard the International Space Station can be exposed to almost 100 times the typical dose rate at sea level(cite). Additionally, data from the CraTER cosmic ray telescope aboard NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has shown that cosmic ray flux in the earth moon system has been increasing over the last 50 years and has just recently reached a historical maximum(cite). These factors seem to point towards the necessity of the development of a low cost and accurate device for measuring absorbed dose from cosmic radiation in-situ rather than relying on simulation or modeling for calculating maximum exposure. 

During the High Altitude Student Platform (HASP) 2017 and 2018 flights \cite{hasp}, the SORA payload carried a MiniPIX hybrid pixel detector interfaced with a Raspberry Pi Single Board Computer to test the feasibility of such a system for real-time measurements of absorbed dose from cosmic radiation. The MiniPIX was set to operate in Time over Threshhold mode with a bias voltage of 4 Kev, frames were collected at static 4 second intervals during the 2017 flight and between 1 and 4 second intervals for the 2018 flight. Data from the MiniPIX was analyzed in real time and counts and absorbed dose were downlinked in real time through the HASP downlink interface. 
The HASP 2017 flight launched from Fort Sumner, New Mexico on August 4th, 2017 at 14:04 UTC and ascended to a float altitude of approximately $\SI{31.5}{\kilo\meter}$ at 16:22 UTC; which was maintained for approximately \SI{10.5}{\hour}. On September 4th, 2018 at 14:03 UTC the HASP 2018 mission also launched from Fort Sumner, Mew Mexico.  The 2018 payload reached a stable float altitude of $\SI{37.2}{\kilo\meter}$ at 16:30 UTC and the total float duration was approximately \SI{9.0}{\hour}. The first payload drifted west for a total ground distance of \SI{580}{\kilo\meter} and was recovered just north of the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest in Arizona. The 2018 payload terminated its flight and landed approximately \SI{96.6}{\kilo\meter} southwest of Mt Graham, Arizona after traveling a total distance of \SI{550}{\kilo\meter}.

%%% GCR's and Regener-Pfotzer Maxiumum, space flight ----- Work in Progress
Space radiation and galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) pose real health risks to astronauts and pilots in any field.  Radiation exposure in Low Earth Orbit and the atmosphere must be monitored to ensure they do not exceed the occupational dose limits.  The ability to measure real-time exposure is arguably a crucial tool that can help mitigate risks.  Studying radiation types and dose levels near the nebulous border between space and Earth's atmosphere, and within the various zones of the atmosphere, facilitates preparation for current and future space missions; and aviation in general.  
%No edits have been made after this point yet.
To monitor the radiation in the upper atmosphere and beyond, a USB TimePIX device could be effectively used as a low cost dosimeter.  TimePIX detectors have many applications in the realm of particle physics, specially with their small physical and power consumption footprint. Overall, TimePIX devices could be setup to create a network of devices to better understand the Earth space radiation environment and observe space weather.

Numerous balloon flights have included the use of TimePIX devices for the purposes of particle imaging and radiation dosimetry in unusual and unfamiliar environments, such as the stratosphere \cite{bexus}. 
%
The International Space Station (ISS) uses TimePIX devices to evaluate the astronauts' exposure to ionizing radiation fields \cite{timepix}.
% below is an actual space

The TimePIX device used in this flight was a MiniPIX, which is a silicon-based hybrid pixel detector built by ADVACAM \cite{advacam}. 
%
The sensor surface offers a resolution of 256x256 pixels.
%
The device can be operated under one of three modes: time-of-arrival (TOA) or time-over-threshold (TOT), or single particle counting.

%When a particle ionizes with the silicon chip, the deposited charge is depleted by a bias voltage in a process known as Carrier generation and recombination. \textbf{<<Verify the previous statement>>}
%I think we can simplify this statement into this, since we don't have to go too deep into the background.  Just the basics works.
When a charged particle interacts with the silicon chip, ionization currents are created which are detected and measured by the device.

%For the SORA flights, the MiniPIX was coupled with a low cost open ARM based computer.  Both flights utilized a Raspberry Pi 3 to communicate and handle all operations with the MiniPIX.  This system allowed for remote operation and on-board analyzation of all data.  The SORA flights tested the feasibility of these low-cost systems to fly further space missions.
