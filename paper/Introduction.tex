%Introducing GCRs here and Victor Hess  - discovery of GCR's : https://sci-hub.tw/10.1038/123155a0
First discovered by Victor F. Hess~\cite{hess}, cosmic radiation penetrates deep into Earth's atmosphere and creates a highly complex radiation enviroment.  This cosmic radiation is comprised mostly of primary particles originating from Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) and Solar Energetic Particles (SEP).  GCRs and incoming cosmic rays are affected by various factors, such as solar activity and particle energy.
%Introduce the Solar Cycle and its modulation and how it affects flux of cosmic radiation.
%the solar cycle and GCR flux relationship - the solar cycle is inversely related to GCR flux
In particular, the Sun influences the intensity of the GCR flux substantially - referred to as solar modulation~\cite{abe}.  Interestingly, the solar cycle is inversely related to GCR flux~\cite{hathaway}, i.e. if the sun is at solar minimum then the GCR flux is at a maximum.

%SEP and GCR - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11542509
As primary particles from SEP and GCR approach the Earth's upper atmosphere, they undergo nuclear interactions.  These interactions produce air showers - cascades of secondary particles that dive into Earth's atmosphere.
%Regener Pfotzer Max Background
Air showers increase in intensity and reach a maximum between \SI{16}{\km} and \SI{18}{\km}, known as the Regener-Pfotzer Maximum\cite{regener}. The nuclear interactions and production of particles gradually decline as altitude decreases.  Even with a steady decline, there is still a high amount of radiation in the upper atmosphere.
% After some point, the shower maximum, more particles are stopped than created and the number of shower particles declines. Only a small fraction of the particles usually comes down to the ground. 
%Not sure what to do with this statements...
%After reaching peak ionization rates, air showers gradually decrease steadily while decreasing in altitude. 
%After reaching peak ionization rates, the flux of secondary and primary particles decreases steadily while decreasing in altitude.  
%The Regener-Pfotzer Maximum was first discovered by Erich Regener and Georg Pfotzer in 1935~\cite{regener}
%
%%%Suggested Guzik Changes:  Addition to background
%Need more background on the Regener-Pfotzer Maximum - look at main source!
%Need more information regarding primary cosmic rays undergoing nuclear interactions - aka air showers.
%Particles generated peak around 50,000 ft / 15 km.
%Need to mention solar cycle (don't go in-depth though!)  Talk about it and its modulation.
%Solar cycle has 11 year cycle between maximums, and its rotation, magnetic field interactions, and sun spots all affect the radiation environment.

%Talk about importance to measure this radiation:
The large amount of ionizing radiation in high altitudes has implications to passengers and crew aboard high flying aircraft and astronauts in low earth orbit (LEO), who will absorb a much higher biological dose than they would at the Earth's surface. 
%%%As of 08/26/2019 this ENDS Sam's changes for now - must be reviewed

According to research from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Civil Aerospace Medical Institute, passengers and crew on-board a flight from London to Los Angeles will be exposed to an average effective dose of \SI{61.6}{\micro\sievert} \cite{faa}. Furthermore, measurements taken aboard the International Space Station (ISS) shows that ISS crew members can be exposed to dose rates on the order of \SI{200}{\micro\sievert} per day. Exposure to high levels of ionizing radiation increases the risk of cancer and may be linked to other health risks such as increased rate of birth defects and miscarriages \cite{flightatt}.

%Another possible source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4510952/ and further confirmed by: https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/aircrew/reproductivehealth.html
%s. "For flight attendants, a NIOSH study found that exposure to 0.1 mGy (0.36 mSv) or more of cosmic radiation in the first trimester may be linked to increased risk of miscarriage"
Additionally, data from the CRaTER cosmic ray telescope aboard NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has shown that dose rate from cosmic rays in the vicinity of the moon has reached the highest level observed since the beginning of the space age \cite{crater}. The health risks associated with exposure to radiation in the atmosphere and in space combined with the increase in cosmic ray intensity during solar minimum periods point towards the necessity of the development of a relatively low cost device for monitoring the radiation environment in real-time.

%%%START As of 08/26/2019
%%Suggested Guzik Changes: We need to include more background on the MiniPIX
%this includes more discussion about our instrument
%include and discuss relevant figures
%include electronic circuits/configuration
%Discuss intrument development
%need general background of instrument (From Renshaw: It was developed by the TimePIX/MiniPIX Collaboration originally and commercialized and sold by Advacam, you should make this point more clear, and then also give a reference to the original Collaboration paper that introduces the devices.
%Talk about minipix works! how we can get dose from the device - there is no derivation from the counts!
%include talk about Clusters and cluster types - 
%%what is a cluster type and why should anyone care (include relevant figures)
%What are LET and Quality Factors and why are they important
%Show it works (this is our raw data!)
The MiniPIX is a portable radiation camera developed by the TimePIX/MiniPIX Collaboration and commercialized by Advacam~\cite{advacam}.  It utilizes a 256x256 pixel silicon TimePIX Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) and a USB readout interface. The device can be operated under one of three modes: time-of-arrival (TOA), time-over-threshold (TOT), or single particle counting. 
%%% Guzik recommends we explain what the different modes mean:
%TOA:TOA mode measures the time from when the preamp goes high against the threshold until the end of the acquisition frame.Time of Arrival - measures the arrival time of a pulse. In TOA mode the chip measures the particle arrival time by counting from when the preamplifier goes high on the discriminator to the end of the acquisition (which can be triggered in hardware, or in software).
%
%TOT: The TOT mode in the Timepix ASIC measures the time elapsed while the preamp output is high against the threshold discriminator. • Time Over Threshold (TOT) - charge measurement. In TOT mode whenever the pulse is high against the discriminator the pixel counts until the pulse is low again. This allows each pixel to act as a Wilkinson type ADC measuring the discharge time of the preamplifier (i.e. the time spent over the threshold). The minimum threshold is about 1000 electrons or 3.6keV with a silicon sensor. As each pixel is individually programmable, it is possible to operate different pixels in different modes during the same acquisition.
%
%Single Particle Counting: "MediPIX mode" In Medipix mode the chip counts the number of times the signal goes higher than the threshold. Medipix - photon/pulse counting.
%
The MiniPIX is capable of individual particle differentiation and when operating in TOT mode can be used to measure dosimetric endpoints such as absorbed dose and dose equivalent. Similar devices to the MiniPIX utilizing a TimePIX ASIC have been evaluated on high altitude balloon flights by Urbar et.al \cite{bexus} and are currently deployed on the ISS for performing real-time space radiation monitoring \cite{timepixiss}. However, the usage of the MiniPIX in combination with a low cost single board computer as a portable radiation monitoring device has yet to be fully explored. The SORA flights in 2017 and 2018 served as a test bed for such a system.

During the High Altitude Student Platform (HASP) 2017 and 2018 flights \cite{hasp}, the SORA payloads carried a MiniPIX interfaced with a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ (RPI) Single Board Computer~\cite{rpi} to test the feasibility of a system for real-time measurements of absorbed dose from cosmic radiation. Data, such as counts and absorbed dose from the MiniPIX, was downlinked and analyzed in real time through the HASP downlink interface. The HASP 2017 flight launched from Fort Sumner, New Mexico on September 4th, 2017 at 14:04 UTC and ascended to a float altitude of approximately $\SI{31.5}{\kilo\meter}$ at 16:22 UTC; which was maintained for approximately \SI{10.5}{\hour}. The HASP 2017 payload drifted west for a total ground distance of \SI{580}{\kilo\meter} and was recovered just north of the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest in Arizona.  On September 4th, 2018 at 14:03 UTC the HASP 2018 mission launched from Fort Sumner, Mew Mexico.  The 2018 payload reached a stable float altitude of $\SI{37.2}{\kilo\meter}$ at 16:30 UTC and the total float duration was approximately \SI{9.0}{\hour}. The 2018 payload terminated its flight and landed approximately \SI{96.6}{\kilo\meter} southwest of Mt Graham, Arizona after traveling a total distance of \SI{550}{\kilo\meter}.
