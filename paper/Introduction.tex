During the HASP 2017\cite{hasp} flight the MiniPIX hybrid pixel detector\cite{minipix} was used to measure the levels of cosmic radiation experienced by the SORA payload\cite{sora}. Presented in this paper are the measurements taken using the MiniPIX during the aforementioned HASP stratospheric balloon flight. The MiniPIX internally utilizes a TimePIX silicon detector originally designed at CERN\cite{cern} and communicates over a USB interface provided by ADVACAM\cite{advacam}. The detector was interfaced with a Raspberry PI 3(RPI3) and operated autonomously in time over threshhold mode allowing each pixel to act as a Wilkinson type ADC allowing the measurement of deposited energy on a per pixel basis. Data was collected during the duration of the HASP 2017 flight that launched from Fort Sumner New Mexico on August 4th 2017. The HASP payload ascended to a float altitude of $\sim{}\SI{35.5}{\kilo\meter}$ that was maintained for $\sim{}10.5$ hours. During the duration of the flight the payload drifted west a total ground distance of \SI{580}{\kilo\meter} and was recovered just north of the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest in Arizona.
