\section{Introduction}
\label{Introduction}

The atmospheric radiation environment is highly complex and is comprised mostly of a mix of primary and secondary particles originating from Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs). Primary GCRs interact with atoms and molecules in the Earth's upper atmosphere and produce cascades of secondary particles that increase in intensity until reaching a maximum between \SI{16}{\km} and \SI{18}{\km}, known as the Regener-Pfotzer Maximum\cite{regener}. After reaching peak ionization rates, the flux of secondary and primary particles decreases steadily while decreasing in altitude, until reaching a minimum near the Earth's surface. The increase in ionizing radiation with altitude has implications to passengers and crew aboard high flying aircraft and astronauts in low earth orbit (LEO), who will absorb a much higher biological dose than they would at the Earth's surface. 

According to research from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Civil Aerospace Medical Institute, passengers and crew onboard a flight from London to Los Angeles will be exposed to an average effective dose of \SI{61.6}{\micro\sievert} \cite{faa}. Furthermore, measurements taken aboard the International Space Station (ISS) shows that ISS crew members can be exposed to dose rates on the order of \SI{200}{\micro\sievert} per day. Exposure to high levels of ionizing radiation increases the risk of cancer and may be linked to other health risks such as increased rate of birth defects and miscarriages \cite{flightatt}.

Additionally, data from the CRaTER cosmic ray telescope aboard NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has shown that dose rate from cosmic rays

in the vicinity of the moon has reached the highest level observed since the beginning of the space age \cite{crater}.
%%%begin Guzik suggested changes:
The health risks associated with exposure to radiation in the atmosphere and in space combined with the increase in cosmic ray intensity during solar minimum periods point towards the necessity of the development of a relatively low cost device for monitoring the radiation environment in real-time.


The MiniPIX is a portable radiation camera developed by the TimePIX/MiniPIX Collaboration and commercialized by Advacam (CITE ME).  %need help here; bring up at meeting.  From Renshaw: It was developed by the TimePIX/MiniPIX Collaboration originally and commercialized and sold by Advacam, you should make this point more clear, and then also give a reference to the original Collaboration paper that introduces the devices.
%
It utilizes a 256x256 pixel silicon TimePIX Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) and a USB readout interface. The device can be operated under one of three modes: time-of-arrival (TOA), time-over-threshold (TOT), or single particle counting. 
%%% Guzik recommends we explain what the different modes mean:
%TOA:TOA mode measures the time from when the preamp goes high against the threshold until the end of the acquisition frame.Time of Arrival - measures the arrival time of a pulse. In TOA mode the chip measures the particle arrival time by counting from when the preamplifier goes high on the discriminator to the end of the acquisition (which can be triggered in hardware, or in software).
%
%TOT: The TOT mode in the Timepix ASIC measures the time elapsed while the preamp output is high against the threshold discriminator. • Time Over Threshold (TOT) - charge measurement. In TOT mode whenever the pulse is high against the discriminator the pixel counts until the pulse is low again. This allows each pixel to act as a Wilkinson type ADC measuring the discharge time of the preamplifier (i.e. the time spent over the threshold). The minimum threshold is about 1000 electrons or 3.6keV with a silicon sensor. As each pixel is individually programmable, it is possible to operate different pixels in different modes during the same acquisition.
%
%Single Particle Counting: "MediPIX mode" In Medipix mode the chip counts the number of times the signal goes higher than the threshold. Medipix - photon/pulse counting.
%
The MiniPIX is capable of individual particle differentiation and when operating in TOT mode can be used to measure dosimetric endpoints such as absorbed dose and dose equivalent. Similar devices to the MiniPIX utilizing a TimePIX ASIC have been evaluated on high altitude balloon flights by Urbar et.al \cite{bexus} and are currently deployed on the ISS for performing real-time space radiation monitoring \cite{timepixiss}. However, the usage of the MiniPIX in combination with a low cost single board computer as a portable radiation monitoring device has yet to be fully explored. The SORA flights in 2017 and 2018 served as a test bed for such a system.

%Space radiation and galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) pose real health risks to astronauts and pilots in any field.  Radiation exposure in Low Earth Orbit and the atmosphere must be monitored to ensure they do not exceed the occupational dose limits.  The ability to measure real-time exposure is arguably a crucial tool that can help mitigate risks.  Studying radiation types and dose levels near the nebulous border between space and Earth's atmosphere, and within the various zones of the atmosphere, facilitates preparation for current and future space missions; and aviation in general.  

%To monitor the radiation in the upper atmosphere and beyond, a USB TimePIX device could be effectively used as a low cost dosimeter.  TimePIX detectors have many applications in the realm of particle physics, specially with their small physical and power consumption footprint. Overall, TimePIX devices could be setup to create a network of devices to better understand the Earth space radiation environment and observe space weather.
%
%Numerous balloon flights have included the use of TimePIX devices for the purposes of particle imaging and radiation dosimetry in unusual and unfamiliar environments, such as the stratosphere \cite{bexus}.

During the High Altitude Student Platform (HASP) 2017 and 2018 flights \cite{hasp}, the SORA payloads carried a MiniPIX interfaced with a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ (RPI) Single Board Computer (CITE ME) to test the feasibility of a system for real-time measurements of absorbed dose from cosmic radiation. Data, such as counts and absorbed dose from the MiniPIX, was downlinked and analyzed in real time through the HASP downlink interface. The HASP 2017 flight launched from Fort Sumner, New Mexico on September 4th, 2017 at 14:04 UTC and ascended to a float altitude of approximately $\SI{31.5}{\kilo\meter}$ at 16:22 UTC; which was maintained for approximately \SI{10.5}{\hour}. The HASP 2017 payload drifted west for a total ground distance of \SI{580}{\kilo\meter} and was recovered just north of the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest in Arizona.  On September 4th, 2018 at 14:03 UTC the HASP 2018 mission launched from Fort Sumner, Mew Mexico.  The 2018 payload reached a stable float altitude of $\SI{37.2}{\kilo\meter}$ at 16:30 UTC and the total float duration was approximately \SI{9.0}{\hour}. The 2018 payload terminated its flight and landed approximately \SI{96.6}{\kilo\meter} southwest of Mt Graham, Arizona after traveling a total distance of \SI{550}{\kilo\meter}.

%For the SORA flights, the MiniPIX was coupled with a low cost open ARM based computer.  Both flights utilized a Raspberry Pi 3 to communicate and handle all operations with the MiniPIX.  This system allowed for remote operation and on-board analyzation of all data.  The SORA flights tested the feasibility of these low-cost systems to fly further space missions.
