## Writing Latex

Google is your friend. But we all get stuck so ask if something is not clear or if you're seconds away from pulling your hair out. Use any text editor you like. There exists tools like Texmaker and TeXstudio that make it nice and simple. Or, if you are like me and aren't afraid of a little command-line interface, you can compile, write using VIM, version control, and be effecient  all in your terminal window like real men and women. But it's all preferance.
